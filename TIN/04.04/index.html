            <h1> Zodiac Signs of Skateboarding </h1>
            <p> <b> HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY? </b> Would you believe a vast web of cosmic connections involving our solar system (and the stars beyond), affected your every minute? 
                That's right, whether this day brings you morning wood, wheelbite, an NBD, an STD, or just barfing up a burrito, all these things are influenced by your galactic gang-sign: the Zodiac.
                You know the deal, astrology is the ancient pseudoscience that claims your character and destiny are understood by how the universe was aligned when you landed your very first make: a roll-in from your mom's womb.
